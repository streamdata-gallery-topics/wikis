description: OSF provides free and open source project management support for researchers
  across the entire research lifecycle. As a collaboration tool, OSF helps researchers
  work on projects privately with a limited number of collaborators and make parts
  of their projects public, or make all the project publicly accessible for broader
  dissemination. As a workflow system, OSF enables connections to the many services
  researchers already use to streamline their process and increase efficiency. As
  a flexible repository, it can store and archive research data, protocols, and materials.

  description: |-
    List of wiki pages on a node.
    ####Returns
    Paginated list of the node's current wiki page versions ordered by their date_modified. Each resource contains the full representation of the wiki, meaning additional requests to an individual wiki's detail view are not necessary.

    Note that if an anonymous view_only key is being used, the user relationship will not be exposed.

    If the request is unsuccessful, a JSON object with an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#Introduction_error_codes) to understand why this request may have failed.
    #### Filtering
    Wiki pages can be filtered based on their `name` and `date_modified` fields.
    + `filter[name]=<Str>` -- filter wiki pages by name
    + `filter[date_modified][comparison_operator]=YYYY-MM-DDTH:M:S` -- filter wiki pages based on date modified.

    Possible comparison operators include 'gt' (greater than), 'gte'(greater than or equal to), 'lt' (less than) and 'lte' (less than or equal to). The date must be in the format YYYY-MM-DD and the time is optional.
